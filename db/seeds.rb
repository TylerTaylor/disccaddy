A great performing golf disc that can take and hold the angle of release. Throw it flat, it goes straight, give it some angle and you can get it to go right or left. Turnover shots stay turned over and hyzer shots stay hyzer. Excellent for staying on narrow fairways and threading through forests. It works great for beginners with a friendly grip, good glide, and straight flights. It will also impress top players with its solid performance regardless of power. Players are always looking for an out-of-the box straight flyer. This is it.It is a great choice for stable straight shots, slight-hyzer shots, mid-range sidearm disc. Throw it hard, it is not afraid. Throw it smooth, that works too. This is a great woods disc and works like a driver without the skip when it lands. Beginner friendly.Speed 4, Glide 5, Turn 0, Fade 0About Echo Star in general - it is a blend of high-tech recycled plastic with a minimum of 80% and up to 100% pre-consumer plastic. It provides nearly the same durability as other Innova premium plastics with a superior grip, even better grip than the already grippy Star plastic. Echo Star has great characteristics and it's environmentally friendly too. About Color and Availability - pictured above are some available Echo Star colors.

It is the preferred mid range disc golf disc for 12 time World Champion, Ken Climo. It is a larger diameter, 21.7 cm disc.It is a great choice for an experienced player's utility disc, hyzer shots, anhyzer shots, turnover shots when worn, sidearm approaches, and players who like to carry several versions of the same disc in various states of wear. It's the number one professional mid range disc. It is very reliable at the high speeds that pros throw. It ages slowly, becoming an excellent slow turning disc as it wears.Speed 4, Glide 4, Turn 0, Fade 3(The Star San Marino - A blast from the past with a new age twist.

Disc.create("name"=>"Gateway Magic Super Stupid Soft - \"S\"", "description"=>"The Gateway Magic Super Stupid Soft - \"S\" is a popular Gateway putter and approach disc and one of the best all around discs for new players as well as more experienced players. It is a beadless, straight flying putt and approach disc that can be easily used by beginners because of its great glide and small amount of low speed fade. This is also an easy disc to turn over and will hold just about any line it is thrown without 'hyzering out.' The Magic has a more blunt nose than the other Gateway putters, which allows it to maintain longer spinning action because of the added gyroscopic weight distribution in the rim. The nose is a little more blunt than the Wizard making it less high speed stable and less low speed over-stable. What that means is the magic is a very easy golf disc to throw. Speed 4, Glide 8, Fade 0, Turn 2 Available in the \"S\" Series. Weights 165-175 grams.

It is produced with bright candy transparent colors. Proton plastic is comprised of the most durable polymers to offer high performance and withstand the roughest conditions. It has such great clarity and durability because the central core is not contaminated with any weighting agents like most conventional golf discs. The weight products are placed in the outer ring to enhance the GYRO™ Technology and maintain polymer purity in the central core so that the beautiful colors are always vivid and clear. Another unique advantage of the polyurethane MVP uses is the vast variety of flexibility. Ions are available in Medium and Soft.Neutron plastic (new 07/12) is a polymer blend that offers a premium look and feel while maintaining the excellent durability of Proton plastic.

The Epic golf disc is designed to be adjusted to each individual's throwing style and speed. Properly adjusted or tuned, you will throw it farther than any other disc. A card with tuning instructions comes with each disc.Aerobie has one word of caution. You will almost certainly not like your first few throws with an Epic driver. Driving the Epic is like driving a Ferrari. It requires skill, concentration, and experience. If you take the time to test throw and adjust or tune the disc to your throwing speed and style, you will learn to capitalize on the EpicHow does the Epic golf disc's off-centeredness help it fly especially far?The larger a golf disc’s rim width, the farther the golf disc will fly because a wide rim reduces drag. Unfortunately, a rim wider than about an inch is difficult to grip properly. Older design long range drivers typically have rim widths of about ¾”. Newer design ultra long range drivers typically have rim widths approaching 1” for lower drag and greater distance. The Epic driver has an average rim width of 1 5/16” for amazingly low drag and greater distance but to provide a good throwing grip, the rim narrows to 1” in one area. The rim gradually increases as you go around the disc with a maximum width of 1 5/8” directly across from the grip area.

It has the finesse you need when the course throws you curves. 21.2 cm diameterSpeed 11, Glide 5, Turn -2, Fade 2About Star plastic in general - it has the durability of Champion plastic with the superior all-weather grip of Pro plastic. Star discs have the same flight rating characteristics of Champion discs, although some Star Lite discs may be slightly more high-speed stable. Star retains flight characteristics longer than DX or Pro Plastics.About Color and Availability - pictured above are some available Star colors.

Disc.create("name"=>"Innova Krait - Blizzard Champion", "description"=>"The Innova Blizzard Champion Krait is a distance driver with good straight line stability that handles power well. The comfortably smooth rim glides quite cleanly through the air. The Krait should prove popular with players who normally throw understable discs and are looking for a stable flyer.The Krait sits between the Wraith and Archon in the speed 11 range. It has similar stability to the TeeDevil with a slightly smaller rim to appeal to a wider range of throwers. The Krait's unique ability to achieve a mellow low speed fade, while simultaneously resisting high speed turn makes it a perfect choice for long range shot shaping off the tee. The Krait provides a stable flight with a straight finish for most players. Power players can expect some turn for reliable shot shaping.Power players will be able to use the Krait as a finesse driver or long range roller. Moderate arm speed produces a straight, long drive. Although the Krait doesn't have a lot of fade, it's still a very effective driver in windy conditions. Sidearm throwers will appreciate the resistance to turn combined with a slow fade at the end of the flight.The Krait is a great choice for straight drives, 'Go to' distance drives and long distance shot shaping.A special limited edition CFR Champ metal Flake Krait was released to raise funds for the 2012 Tim Selinske US Masters championships in Louisville KY on Labor Day Weekend Aug 31 through Sept 2nd.Speed 11, Glide 5, Turn -1, Fade 2.About Champion plastic in general - it is more stable than all other plastics.

They tested materials on Pure, Vision and Bolt discs which have neutral flight characteristics. Their impression of this LE2 plastic was that it was a bit grippier right away without the production slickness found at first in the LE1 discs.May 2012 - The LE2 Test Run had been selected as the new Latitude 64 Eze Line which replaced the Zero Line as Latitude 64 wanted to take this material into discs other than just putters. Zero Line plastic was not possible to use in drivers and midranges which is why they tested alternatives to it. Eze Line was first released in putters. It was more durable than the Zero line and was able to be produced in several degrees of stiffness. Latitude 64 started out with a stiff version when they released the Mercy in this material. Soft Eze was to be available in summer 2012.
